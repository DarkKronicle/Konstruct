# Variables

Variables are a quick way to access information based off of keys.

<details open markdown="block">
  <summary>
    Table of contents
  </summary>
  {: .text-delta }
1. TOC
{:toc}
</details>

## Defining Variables

Variables are very easy to define. Just use the `=` and then the keyword to reference them. This works almost identically to a language like python.

#### EXAMPLE
{: .no_toc }
```
variable = 'hey'
```

Variables should be defined in starting lower camelCase (Same with functions). Case matters, so be sure to follow what the developer has provided.

Variables should be alphanumeric for the most part to not create unnecessarily complex variables.
